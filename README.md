# popi-toolbox
position-pitch decomposition for source tracking and pitch estimation

routines:
---------
popi_demo_simple ... the basic decomposition via dot-products
popi_demo .......... cascade /more powerfull/ decomposition
create_lut ......... lookup-table generation.

figures:
--------
pitch and phase lookup tables (2 vectors)
popi lookup tables (3 matrices)
